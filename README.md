# CC65 Build Solution
Visual Studio makefile solution to build Apple II projects with CC65.

This is a boilerplate VS solution to jumpstart CC65 projects development. The most important file is MAKEFILE: this is where you set your paths to your local tools, e.g. AppleWin, prodos.dsk, Merlin32, AppleCommander, GSPort, etc...

The solution includes 3 projects which were demo'ed at the 2015 [APPLE II FESTIVAL FRANCE (A2FF)](http://www.apple2festivalfrance.fr/).
